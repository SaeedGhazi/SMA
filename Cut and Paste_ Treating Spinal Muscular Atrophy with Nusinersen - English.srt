1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,370
while RNA editing is critical for

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,590
generating the hundreds of thousands of

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,080
proteins that keep us alive slicing

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,000
errors can lead to devastating health

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,410
problems

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,949
one example is an often fatal disease

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,800
called spinal muscular atrophy or SMA

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,949
it's the number one genetic cause of

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,599
infant death SMA is caused by too little

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,820
of a vital protein called survival of

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,149
motor neuron or SMN in the spinal cords

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,570
motor neurons too little of this protein

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,480
causes the motor neuron to die and the

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,149
muscles that control to waste away the

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,719
smn1 gene which produces the SMN protein

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,199
is missing or damaged beyond repair in

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,370
sm a patient humans have a second SMN

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,390
producing gene called smn2 but this gene

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,549
is a poor backup because it produces

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,720
very little functional SMN protein this

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,180
efficiency stems from a mistake during

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,640
RNA editing remember that's the process

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
of forming a coherent are any message

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,290
that removing the gibberish letters or

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,290
in trunk but what is this mistake and

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,050
how does it cause SMA

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,750
let's say the SMN gene generates are any

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,600
copies made up of introns and exons like

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,710
this

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,050
normal RNA splicing will delete the

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,080
intron the gibberish letters in blue and

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,120
leave only the exons the red letters

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,820
generating the following message draw a

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,680
big house on the corner of the wide

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,850
Street in SMA it turns out that during

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,470
RNA splicing the 7x on of smn2 is

37
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,930
skipped by the machinery that edits RNA

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,320
skipping of exon 7 generates a faulty

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,190
message draw a big house on the of the

40
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,460
wide Street just like removing word

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,320
number seven in the sentence leads to a

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,970
statement that makes no sense

43
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,120
removing exon 7 in the RNA results in a

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,420
defective protein remember that SMA

45
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,330
patients have to rely solely on the smn2

46
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,150
gene to produce the survival of motor

47
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,210
neuron protein but due to exon skipping

48
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,210
not enough usable protein is made to

49
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,530
support normal muscle development

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,250
infants born with the most severe form

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,950
of SMA often don't make it to the second

52
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,440
birthday but researchers have been

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,480
studying how to fix this placing problem

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,620
one solution is called knew sooner ssin

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,220
it enables SMA patients to make more SMN

56
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,549
protein but how new Sanderson is a short

57
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,280
sequence of RNA that binds just after

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,489
exon 7 in the end edited RNA message

59
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,450
this tiny piece of RNA prevents exon 7

60
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,629
from being skipped it is called an

61
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,459
antisense oligonucleotides or a sox10

62
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,310
seven is now included in the edited

63
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,290
already message which in turn generates

64
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:24,220
full-length functional sm and protein by

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,709
preventing exon 7 from being skipped new

66
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,900
Sanderson reverses symptoms and SMA
